# llm_sugarscape
Visualizing Sugarscape with LLMs.

## Aim:
Show how sugarscape can still hold true, when F(x) is determined by LLM.

## Plan for article:
1. Explain about SABM. - and schelling simulation
2. Give mathematical intuition - about trivial soln, no soln and soln exists conditions.
3. What we want to see with LLM. - check whether and where soln exists.
4. Experiment - defn and design; analysis of results and what to make of this.
